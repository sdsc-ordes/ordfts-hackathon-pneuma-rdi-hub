    <div class="caution-box">
        <p><strong>CAUTION</strong></p>
        <p>This project is not an official RDI Hub by the pNeuma team. It is a prototype created for the hackathon and intended to serve as inspiration. We would like to express our gratitude to the pNeuma team for their support and guidance in this endeavor.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This is an example of a hackathon project proposing a Research Data Infrastructure (RDI) Hub prototype around the pNeuma project. The RDI is designed with simplicity in mind, a flexible structure that allows iterative development next to the community, and a low operational cost. For these reasons, the RDI takes advantage of GitHub technology in order to host a catalog of research assets, provide a discussion forum, and distribute the content via GitHub Pages.</p>
